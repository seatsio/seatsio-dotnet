## Versioning

seatsio-dotnet follows semver since v70.2.0.
	
## Usage

### General instructions

To use this library, you'll need to create a `SeatsioClient`:

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
...
```

You can find your _workspace secret key_ in the [settings section of the workspace](https://app.seats.io/workspace-settings).

The region should correspond to the region of your account:

- `Region.EU()`: Europe
- `Region.NA()`: North-America
- `Region.SA()`: South-America
- `Region.OC()`: Oceania

If you're unsure about your region, have a look at your [company settings page](https://app.seats.io/company-settings).

### Creating a chart and an event

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;
using SeatsioDotNet.Charts;
using SeatsioDotNet.Events;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
var chart = await client.Charts.CreateAsync();
var evnt = await client.Events.CreateAsync(chart.Key);
```

### Booking objects

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
await client.Events.BookAsync(<EVENT KEY>, new [] { "A-1", "A-2"});
```

### Releasing objects

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
await client.Events.ReleaseAsync(<EVENT KEY>, new [] { "A-1", "A-2"});
```

### Booking objects that have been held

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
await client.Events.BookAsync(<EVENT KEY>, new [] { "A-1", "A-2"}, <A HOLD TOKEN>);
```

### Changing object status

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
await client.Events.ChangeObjectStatusAsync(""<EVENT KEY>"", new [] { "A-1", "A-2"}, "unavailable");
```

### Retrieving the published version of a chart (i.e. the actual drawing, containing the venue type, categories etc.)

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
var drawing = await client.Charts.RetrievePublishedVersionAsync(<CHART KEY>);
Console.WriteLine(drawing.VenueType);
```

### Retrieving object category and status (and other information)

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
var objectInfos = await Client.Events.RetrieveObjectInfosAsync(evnt.Key, new string[] {"A-1", "A-2"});

Console.WriteLine(objectInfos["A-1"].CategoryKey);
Console.WriteLine(objectInfos["A-1"].CategoryLabel);
Console.WriteLine(objectInfos["A-1"].Status);

Console.WriteLine(objectInfos["A-2"].CategoryKey);
Console.WriteLine(objectInfos["A-2"].CategoryLabel);
Console.WriteLine(objectInfos["A-2"].Status);
```

### Listing a chart's categories

```csharp
var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");
IEnumerable<Category> categoryList = await client.Charts.ListCategoriesAsync(<chart key>);
foreach (var category in categoryList)
{
    Console.Write(category.Label);
}
```

### Listing all charts

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>");

var charts = await client.Charts.ListAllAsync();
foreach (var chart in charts)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Chart " + chart.Key);
}
```

Note: `listAllAsync()` returns an IAsyncEnumerable`, which under the hood calls the seats.io API to fetch charts page by page. So multiple API calls may be done underneath to fetch all charts.

### Listing charts page by page

E.g. to show charts in a paginated list on a dashboard.

```csharp
// ... user initially opens the screen ...

var firstPage = await client.Charts.ListFirstPageAsync();
foreach (var chart in firstPage.Items)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Chart " + chart.Key);
}
```

```csharp
// ... user clicks on 'next page' button ...

var nextPage = await client.Charts.ListPageAfterAsync(firstPage.NextPageStartsAfter);
foreach (var chart in nextPage.Items)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Chart " + chart.Key);
}
```

```csharp
// ... user clicks on 'previous page' button ...

var previousPage = await client.Charts.ListPageBeforeAsync(nextPage.PreviousPageEndsBefore);
foreach (var chart in previousPage.Items)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Chart " + chart.Key);
}
```

### Creating a workspace

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<COMPANY ADMIN KEY>");
await client.Workspaces.CreateAsync("a workspace");
```

### Creating a chart and an event with the company admin key

```csharp
using SeatsioDotNet;

var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<COMPANY ADMIN KEY>", "<WORKSPACE PUBLIC KEY>"); // workspace public key can be found on https://app.seats.io/workspace-settings
var chart = await client.Charts.CreateAsync();
var evnt = await client.Events.CreateAsync(chart.Key);
```

## Error handling

When an API call results in a 4xx or 5xx error (e.g. when a chart could not be found), a SeatsioException is thrown.

This exception contains a message string describing what went wrong, and also two other properties:

- `Errors`: a list of errors that the server returned. In most cases, this list will contain only one element.
- `RequestId`: the identifier of the request you made. Please mention this to us when you have questions, as it will make debugging easier.


## Rate limiting - exponential backoff

This library supports [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

When you send too many concurrent requests, the server returns an error `429 - Too Many Requests`. The client reacts to this by waiting for a while, and then retrying the request.
If the request still fails with an error `429`, it waits a little longer, and try again. By default this happens 5 times, before giving up (after approximately 15 seconds).

We throw a `RateLimitExceededException` (which is a subclass of `SeatsioException`) when exponential backoff eventually fails.

To change the maximum number of retries, create the `SeatsioClient` as follows:

```csharp
var client = new SeatsioClient(Region.EU(), "<WORKSPACE SECRET KEY>").SetMaxRetries(3);
```

Passing in 0 disables exponential backoff completely. In that case, the client will never retry a failed request.
